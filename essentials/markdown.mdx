## Functions & this keyword in Javascript

### Functions in JavaScript:

Functions in JavaScript are like reusable blocks of code. They are like mini-programs that you can define once and then use multiple times. In JavaScript, functions are essential for organizing and executing code.

### The this Keyword:
this is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the current context or object. Its value is determined at the time a function is executed. The tricky part is that this might have different values depending on how a function is called.

#### Ways to Invoke a Function:

#### 1. As a normal function:

You define a function and then call it just by its name.

Example:
```javascript index.js
function example() {
console.log("Hello World!")
};
example();
```
#### 2. As a method:

You can have functions as properties of objects, and then you call them using the object they belong to.
Example:
```javascript index.js
// Object representing a car
const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Camry",
  year: 2022,

  // Method to start the car's engine
  startEngine: function () {
    console.log(`Starting the ${this.brand} ${this.model}'s engine.`);
  }
};

// Calling the method to start the engine
car.startEngine();

```
### 3. As a constructor:

Constructors are used to create new objects based on a blueprint. You use the new keyword to create an instance of an object.
Example:
```javascript index.js
// Constructor function for creating Person objects
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Creating instances of Person using the constructor
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 30);

// Accessing the properties of the created objects
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person2.age);  //  Output: 30
```
In simple terms, these are just different ways to use functions in JavaScript. Sometimes you use them like regular actions, sometimes as part of an object, and sometimes to create new things. Understanding when to use each way is important for writing effective and organized code in JavaScript.
